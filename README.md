# Home-Prices-Driving-Factors
Using excel, I performed data analysis of Home prices of 1460 houses in Ames, Iowa that were sold between 2006-2010. As Investors lend money to home buyers in mortgage-backed securities, success is dependent on the bankâ€™s ability to identify promising investments. By identifying different qualities and home features that impact home prices, I made better investment decisions. As an analyst, my objective was to analyze the statistical relationships of home factors and home prices and identify the driving factors.
